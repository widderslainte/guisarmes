# Training, Basic Rules

* Characters can spend 1 week in training and study
* They **gain** up to 10% of the XP required to reach their next level.
* Training normally costs 1 standard coin (gold piece, or silver piece in a silver standard economy) per XP point to be gained through studying.
* Training can only be done **once** per level
* Training must occur with a tutor, training, or in "civilized army" with equipment or items conducive to training (a library or laboratory for Magicians, sparring equipment for warriors, etc)
* XP gained through training can be the same coins recovered from an adventuring local (and themselves provided XP)
* Example:
  * Gutboy needs a total of 2000 xp to reach level 2.
  * He returns from a dungeon with 500 coins, which provide (as normal) 500xp on the basis of treasure recovery.  He has gained 500xp from treasure, but is still short of the 2000xp needed to advance.
  * He can spend a week and 200 coins (the maximum allowed) and receive 200 xp toward becoming level 2.
