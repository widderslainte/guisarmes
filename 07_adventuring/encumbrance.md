## Encumbrance

### Effects increasing Encumbrance
* Severe heat or effect of armor or heavy clothing in hot conditions.  In hot weather, armor counts as an additional point, even though leathers, etc may themselves not inhibit use of burlar skills any more than usual.
* Insufficient clothing in severe cold or continued exposure.  In severe cold, sufficient clothing itself (bulky furs, etc) may themselves encumber.
* Moving through heavy wind and/or rain, being drenched from rain.
