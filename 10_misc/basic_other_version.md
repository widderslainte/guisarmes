# Guisarmes & Golems, Basic Edition

_Grab images from UK B/X book, historical books_

## Attributes
The basic attributes are nothing unique to Guisarmes & Golems.  Unlike other sections of the rules, I haven’t even bothered to confusingly rename them.  Outside of the direct mechanical effects describe, use whatever interpretation you prefer from your favourite edition or retroclone.

### Generation of Attribute Scores
Roll 3d6 in order.  This order:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma.  Record these and come back to this section once you’ve selected your character’s ancestry.

**Vat Creations (See Appendix):**  can swap any score with Strength. Charisma can not be their highest attribute - in that event swap Strength and Charisma attributes.
**Humans:** can swap any two scores.

Any swapping of scores must result in the attribute listed become higher than initially (i.e, a Vat Creation could not swap an Intelligence of 10 with a Strength of 12).

| Attribute Bonuses ||
| ---------|---------|
| Score	|	Bonus |
| 3-8 	|	-1  |
| 9-12 	|	+/-0 |
| 13+ 	|	+1  |

### Class Abilities
*  Skim off the Top
 Members of the underworld can't keep their hands off loot.  Characters of the burglar (and burglar) class automatically get %1 per level of coin and non-precious stones loot collected by the party before any shares or divisions are calculated.  This represents their penchant for being the first with their hands in the sack, lifting of small amounts of coins during sorting, and intentional miscalculations during the actual division of shares ("one for you, two for me").
 Thieves and burglars gain experience points for any of the above skimming activity as they would for any other treasure.
* Random item of 1sp or less (chalk, string, etc)
* Hidden knife
* Bonuses to activities in town
* No honor among thieves
* Change ranks, swap small items
* Shadow fade - requires larger or outnumber of foes
* Poison
* Gallow’s humor - reduce stress/fear
* Prevent ambush (survival school - share with Ranger or others with skill)

## Appendix C: Optional Rules

### Healing Value
Many items and spells will restore a number of hit points equal to the character's Healing Value. Some more powerful spells and items will restore multiple healing values' worth at once. For example:  Mordante has 21 HP, so his Healing Value (HV) is 5.  A Cure Light Wounds spells heals HV+d6 HP, so he would receive 6-11 HP back.  A Cure Serious Wounds Spell heals two HV+d6, in which case he would be healed 11-16 HP.

Your healing value is calculated as:
Healing Value = Total Hit Points divided by 4 (rounded down). 

Healing Value is changed upon permanent changes in hit points (gaining levels, level drain), but does not change as regular wounds and healing decrease and increase hit points.
