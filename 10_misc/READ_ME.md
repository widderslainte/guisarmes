With the goal of better procedural transparency
* (X2) Is the mule encumbered?  (Maybe not now)
* (X11) By the book, magic-users need one hour of study to memorize spells
* (X11) By the book, magic-users are unavailable training for one week upon gaining a new level
* (X19) Hey, are we counting rations for the hirelings (I recall discussion for the mules)
* (X19) Mapping and what you know by just passing through a hex (versus searching and versus clearing)
* (X51) BTB, Foraging can include small game.  "Real" hunting involves wandering monster rolls
