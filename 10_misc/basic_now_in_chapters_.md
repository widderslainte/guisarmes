# Guisarmes & Golems, Basic Edition

_Grab images from UK B/X book, historical books_

## Attributes
The basic attributes are nothing unique to Guisarmes & Golems.  Unlike other sections of the rules, I haven’t even bothered to confusingly rename them.  Outside of the direct mechanical effects describe, use whatever interpretation you prefer from your favourite edition or retroclone.

### Generation of Attribute Scores
Roll 3d6 in order.  This order:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma.  Record these and come back to this section once you’ve selected your character’s ancestry.

* **Strength:** modifies attack and damage rolls in non-missile combat and open doors
* **Intelligence:** modifies known languages, saves against Magician's spells, and Magician research rolls
* **Wisdom:** modifies saves againt Prophet's spells and Propher research rolls.
* **Dexterity:** modifiers attack rolls in missile combat, armor class (in normal situations)
* **Constitution:** modifiers hit points rolled, other tests and measures of endurance
* **Charisma:** modifiers reaction and loyalty for potential and current hirelings and henchmen

**Vat Creations (See Appendix):**  can swap any score with Strength. Charisma can not be their highest attribute - in that event swap Strength and Charisma attributes.

**Humans:** can swap any two scores.

Any swapping of scores must result in the attribute listed become higher than initially (i.e, a Vat Creation could not swap an Intelligence of 10 with a Strength of 12).

| Score	|	Bonus |
| 3-8 	|	-1  |
| 9-12 	|	+/-0 |

*  *Skim off the Top:** Members of the underworld can't keep their hands off loot.  Characters of the burglar (and burglar) class automatically get %1 per level of coin and non-precious stones loot collected by the party before any shares or divisions are calculated.  This represents their penchant for being the first with their hands in the sack, lifting of small amounts of coins during sorting, and intentional miscalculations during the actual division of shares ("one for you, two for me"). _Thieves and burglars gain experience points for any of the above skimming activity as they would for any other treasure._

## Saving Throws
## Morale



## Health and Healing

### Death
Upon reaching zero hit points, the character collapses and is unstable and barely conscious. The character must immediately make a save versus death, or perish immediately.  A successful save indicates that the character is losing consciousness and bleeding. The character will still dye in 3 rounds or upon taking further damage (such a coup de gras), unless basic medicine treatment (bind of wounds, etc) is applied. 

Nonmagical treatments will bring the character to 1 hit point, but they will remain unconsious until a full day's rest or magical healing occurs.  Spells or other magic capable of immediately restoring hit points will bring the character to 1 hp and consciousness (regardless of the standard effect, such as d8 points from potion).  

### Healing
Natural healing occurs any character who rests one period and has had food and water within the past daily cycle.  The period that rest occurs does not matter, as long it constitutes sleep, medition, or non-strenous activities, but healing rest cannot be achieved more than once a daily cycle.

Full rest restores 1 HP per character hit die.  Example: a 4th level fighter would be healed 4 hp from a full rest.

## Advancement & Experience

### Sources of Experience

#### Treasure:
* 1 silver piece (or equivalent) grants 1 experience point (presuming a silver standard)
* Treasure must be secured, i.e. taken to home location ("base") or banking establishment and outside the encounter area.  Some classes may have special abilities that impact this (thieves and buried treasure, prophets and shrines).  Jewelry and other apparel gained as treasure may be actively worn for one week to gain the xp value - you don't need to keep that ruby studded codpiece at home!
* Magic items may grant experience points.  Expendable items grant their experience points upon identification or use.  Other items must be identified or studied for one week to gain their associated experience points. Only a single party member may ever gain exprience points for any given item - a sword can not be passed around to advance multiple characters.

#### Defeating Foes
* Monsters amd other hostile will provide a standard experience point value based on formulae or static monster listing.  At the referee's discretion they are earned immediately, though at a point of rest or sleep may be more applicable to the style of game.  Foes do not have to be killed or destroyed to gain experiences; surrender, breaking morale, banishment, and similar negation of threat are just as legitimate.
