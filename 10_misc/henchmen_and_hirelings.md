## Attracted Henchmen
* Class(es) that can benefit from this TBD (maybe only benefit for fighters?).
* When you gain a level and spend a week in civilization, roll 1d10.  
* If roll is **less** than the player-characters **new** level, their renown attracts a henchmen of a level equal to the roll.
* Henchman's class determined randomly (current location may affect probability), and attributes, hp, etc rolled.
* Henchman will still require normal share of treasure to venture into dangerous areas (they may have been attracted by hearing of the player character's finds!), but will start with above average loyalty (specific number TBD) . 
* Henchmen's alignment much be compatible with player character's (a cleric of chaos can not serve a cleric of law), but otherwise need not be the same alignment (A chaotic fighter may seek to slaughter masses under a lawful character's watch).
