# TERRAIN

The Forbidden Lands are divided into ten types of terrain. The map is divided into hexagons, which are used to measure distances and govern movement. **One hexagon is 10 kilometers** across. Each hexagon on the map has a certain type of terrain that is used to determine how difficult it is to move in the hexagon as well as what kind of random encounters can
be faced. See the table on page 145.

* **RIVERS** are not a type of terrain in and of themselves, but they work as borders between hexes on the map. Fords and bridges can be used to pass over a river. If there are none, you need a raft or boat to cross a river, or swim across it. Read more about journeys on lakes and rivers below.
* **HIGH MOUNTAINS:** Hexagons with the terrain type HIGH MOUNTAINS block movement. It is impossible to move into these hexagons, and so they form a barrier around the Forbidden Lands.
* **THE IRON LOCK**, standing across the pass to Alderland, is also a barrier that blocks movement completely.
* **THE STILLMIST** is a mythical place in the Elven domains of the north. Whatever hides in there is unknown to the humans of the Forbidden Lands, as well as what lies beyond it.

### TERRAIN TYPES
| **TYPE** | **MOVEMENT** | **FORAGE** | **HUNT** |
|----|----|----|----|
| Plains | Open terrain | –1 | +1
| Forest | Open terrain | +1 | +1
| Dark Forest | Difficult terrain | –1 | 0
| Hills | Open terrain | 0 | 0
| Mountains | Difficult terrain | –2 |–1
| High Mountains | Impassable | – | –
| Lake/River | Requires a boat or raft | – | 0
| Marshlands | Requires a raft | +1 | –1

# QUARTERS OF THE DAY
During journeys, the day is divided into four Quarter Days, used to measure time in the game:
* Morning
* Day
* Evening
* Night

At the start of every Quarter Day, each member of the group must choose what they will do during that Quarter Day. Some activities can be performed by several of the characters at the same time. For other activities, a single
adventurer must be chosen. The various activities are explained in detail over the course of the coming pages.

* **HIKE**. Must be done by all members of the group if you want to move forward on the map.
* **LEAD THE WAY**. Can be combined with HIKE, but can only be done by one adventurer in the group.
* **KEEP WATCH**. Can be combined with HIKE, but can only be done by one adventurer in the group.
* **FORAGE**. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Can be done by several adventurers at the same time.
* **HUNT**. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Can be done by several adventurers at the same time.
* **FISH**. Requires a river or a lake. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Can be done by several adventurers at the same time.
* **MAKE CAMP**. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Only one adventurer rolls.
* **REST**. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Can be done by several adventurers at the same time.
* **SLEEP**. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Can be done by several adventurers at thesame time.
* **EXPLORE**. Cannot be combined with HIKE. Can be done by several adventurers at the same time.

## HIKE
Your journey through the Forbidden Lands progresses from hexagon to hexagon on the map. The rule of thumb is that you can HIKE two hexagons per Quarter Day in OPEN TERRAIN and one hexagon per Quarter Day in DIFFICULT TERRAIN. On horseback, your rate of movement increases to three hexagons per Quarter Day in OPEN TERRAIN. See the table below. Short breaks are included in the specified time, but if you stop for more than a few minutes along the way – because of a mishap or something else – there is a risk you might not be able travel the entire distance during this period. The GM has the final word.

#### HIKING DISTANCE
| TERRAIN | ON FOOT | ON HORSEBACK |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Open    | 2 Hexagons/Quarter | 3 Hexagons/Quarter
| Difficult | 1 Hexagon/Quarter | 1 Hexagon/Quarter

#### FORCED MARCH
You can HIKE for two of the four Quarter Days of the day without problem. If you need to, you can push yourselves and HIKE for a third Quarter Day. This requires that you all make ENDURANCE rolls. Failure means you suffer 1 point of damage to Agility and are unable to HIKE during the Quarter Day – instead, you must REST or SLEEP. If your ENDURANCE roll succeeds, you can choose to leave any stragglers behind and split up the group, or you can stay and wait. If you are in a real rush, you can even attempt to HIKE for a fourth Quarter Day in the day. In that case, you must roll for ENDURANCE again as outlined above, but the roll gets a –2 penalty. Observe that this automatically makes you SLEEPY (see page 111), since you miss the necessary hours of SLEEP per day. Also, see Darkness, below.

#### MOUNTS
Horses and other mounts allow you to move faster through OPEN TERRAIN, but not in DIFFICULT TERRAIN. In addition, a riding animal can carry a number of normal items equal to its Strength doubled if you ride on it, and twice that if you lead it by the halter. A forced march (see above) is also possible while riding. Roll just like you did above, but use your ANIMAL HANDLING and the animal’s Strength. If the roll fails, the animal goes lame. It cannot continue, and another successful ANIMAL HANDLING roll is required for the animal to recover and be able to travel the next day. If this roll fails, there are no options other than to put it down.

## LEAD THE WAY
Every time you move on the map, you must appoint one person to LEAD THE WAY. This individual is called the pathfinder. The pathfinder can LEAD THE WAY and HIKE at the same time, but they cannot also KEEP WATCH (see below). Usually, the same person will act as pathfinder for an entire Quarter Day, but nothing stops you from changing the pathfinder whenever you enter a new hexagon. Every time you enter a new hexagon on the map, the pathfinder makes a SURVIVAL roll, modified by the PATHFINDER talent if she has it. Success means you find a viable path into the hexagon and you move on without any problems. Failure means that you still enter the hexagon, but you suffer a mishap and must immediately roll on the table on the next page.

#### LIGHT & DARKNESS
|---| SPRING | SUMMER | AUTUMN | WINTER |
|---|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Morning   | Light | Light | Light | Dark |
| Daytime   | Light | Light | Light | Light |
| Evening   | Dark | Light | Dark | Dark |
| Nighttime | Dark | Dark | Dark |Dark |

#### DARKNESS
In the dark, travel through the wilderness is dangerous. Getting lost or choosing the wrong path is an ever-present risk. The pathfinder’s rolls get a –2 penalty during the dark Quarter Days of the day, and everyone inthe group without the ability to see in the dark must make a SCOUTING roll – failure means they fall and take 1 point of damage to Strength.

The winters are darker than the summers in the Forbidden Lands. In the winter, there is light only during the Day, while all the other Quarter Days are dark. In autumn and spring there is light in the Morning and Day, while the Evening and the Night are dark. In summer, darkness only reigns during the Night. See the table above.

#### BACK AGAIN?
If you return to a hex on the map where you have been before, you don’t need to make another roll to LEAD THE WAY. It is up to you the players to keep track of where you have been during your journeys.

#### LEADING THE WAY MISHAPS
| D66 | MISHAP | EFFECT |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 11–12 | Quicksand | The ground gives way under your feet. You have walked into an area of quicksand. You are completely stuck, and you must roll MIGHT to escape. If you fail, you suffer 1 point of damage to Agility and must roll again. Whoever pulls free can help anyone who is still stuck. You also need to go around the treacherous area and won’t make any progress on the map during this Quarter Day.
| 13–21 | Blocked Terrain | The way forward is blocked by rocks, fallen trees, thick shrubbery, or flooding (depending on the terrain type in the hex). You must roll MIGHT or MOVE to be able to move forward. If you fail, you suffer 1 point of damage to Strength and must roll again. Anyone who rolls successfully can help anyone who did not. You won’t make any progress on the map during this Quarter Day.
| 22–26 | Lost | You realize that you have walked in a circle. You are lost and won’t make any progress on the map during this Quarter Day. Your pathfinder must also roll SURVIVAL successfully to find her way out of the hexagon. One roll can be made per Quarter Day.
| 31–32 | Sprained Ankle | Your pathfinder falls or twists her ankle and suffers a critical injury, equivalent to result 25–26 in the table for blunt trauma on page 197.
| 33–34 | Torn Clothes | Your clothes are damaged. Your boots break or your robe rips on thorny plants or sharp rocks. You must roll for the effects of cold. Your clothes can be mended by making a successful CRAFTING roll.
| 35–36 | Landslide | You are walking in rough terrain when the ground suddenly opens beneath your feet. You must roll MOVE – if you fail, you suffer an attack with four Base Dice and Weapon Damage 1 (blunt trauma).
| 41–45 | Downpour | A massive rainfall or snow storm (depending on the time of year) catches you unawares. You must roll for the effects of cold (page 111). You must also seek shelter until the storm has passed and won’t make any progress on the map during this Quarter Day.
| 46–52 | Fog | You are caught unawares by a thick fog. The distance you cover this Quarter Day is decreased by one hex. In difficult terrain, you’re stuck in the hex you started. In addition, each adventurer suffers 1 point of damage to Empathy from the gloomy mist.
| 53–54 | Wasps’ Nest | You step right into a nest of wasps. An angry swarm attack the entire group. Each adventurer must make a MOVE roll or suffer an attack with four Base Dice, causing damage to Agility.
| 55–61 | Mosquito Swarm | A large swarm of mosquitoes or gnats attacks you, driving you crazy with their bites and buzzing. They attack with four Base Dice, causing damage to Empathy.
| 62–64 | Savage Animal | A wolf, bear or other wild animal feels threatened, and attacks you. The GM chooses an animal from the table on page 124 of the Gamemaster’s Guide.
| 65–66 Persistent | Animal | A squirrel, bird or other small animal follows you around and doesn’t leave you alone. The animal causes trouble, described by the GM – it might make a noise at some inappropriate time, eat your food or steal something.

## KEEP WATCH
During every Quarter Day of your journey, you should also designate one adventurer in your group who is responsible for scouting for threats and enemies. The lookout can KEEP WATCH and HIKE at the same time, but cannot LEAD THE WAY while doing so. A lookout is useful during every Quarter Day, even after you MAKE CAMP. You don’t need to have a lookout if you don’t want to, but without one you have no chance to spot threats before they are upon you. The scout comes into play when the GM rolls for a random encounter or introduces some other kind of threat. Tables for random encounters, based on which type of terrain dominates the hexagon where the characters find themselves, can be found in Chapter 7 of the Gamemaster’s Guide.

The rule of thumb is that the GM rolls on the random encounter table once every Quarter Day while you HIKE, and once per day if you remain in the same hexagon. Sometimes, the GM can choose to roll more or less frequently. If the random encounter is some sort of threat, the lookout makes a SCOUTING roll to detect it. Make a straight roll, not an opposed roll unless the threat is actively ambushing you. Success generally means that the lookout notices the threat while it’s still at a safe distance. You can then decide whether to show yourselves, set up an ambush, or to SNEAK away undetected. Failing the SCOUTING roll means that the threat is up close and personal before you notice it.

## FORAGE
If you are running out of provisions, you can spend a Quarter Day looking for edible plants and drinkable water. You cannot HIKE at the same time, so if you want to FORAGE you have to stop in the hexagon that you are in. Several adventurers can FORAGE at the same time. If you want to make separate rolls, you can’t FORAGE in the same location, which means that any mishaps will affect you individually. The alternative is that one of you FORAGES and the others help her. To FORAGE, you must choose whether you are looking for food or water. Then make a SURVIVAL roll, modified by the terrain type (see the table on page 145). The roll is also modified by the time of year (see the table to the right).
When looking for food, success means that you find a number of units of VEGETABLES in the form of edible roots or plants, equal to the number of x you rolled. The VEGETABLES can be cooked by a CHEF (see page 74) or at an INN (see page 168), and are then turned into an equal amount of FOOD. You can eat VEGETABLES raw – you then consume a unit of VEGETABLES instead of rolling your Resource Die for FOOD. You need to do this within a day, or the VEGETABLES will be spoiled.
When looking for water, success means that you find enough drinkable water for everyone in your group to fill their water skins up to a D12 Resource Die, if they like. If your FORAGE roll fails, you don’t find any food or water and you suffer a mishap. Roll on the table to the left

#### SEASONS
| SEASON | FORAGE |
|--------|--------|
|Spring | –1
|Summer | 0
|Autumn | +1
|Winter | –2

#### FORAGING MISHAPS
|D6 | MISHAP | EFFECT |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 |Poisonous | You find one unit of VEGETABLES, but it is poisonous, something you only discover during your next meal. The poison in the VEGETABLES has a Potency of 3.
| 2 | Leeches | Blood sucking leeches bite into your flesh and you suffer 1 point of damage to Strength. The leeches can be removed by making a successful HEALING roll. If you fail the roll you suffer another point of damage, but manage to get them off anyway.
| 3 | Sprained Ankle | You fall or twist your ankle and suffer a critical injury, equivalent to result 25–26 in the table for blunt trauma on page 197.
| 4 | Torn Clothes | Your clothes are damaged. Your boots break or your robe snags on thorny plants or sharp rocks. You must roll for the effects of cold. Your clothes can be mended by making a successful CRAFTING roll.
| 5 | Savage Animal | A wolf, bear or other wild animal feels threatened, and attacks you. The GM chooses an animal from the table on page 124 of the Gamemaster’s Guide.
| 6 | Persistent Animal | A squirrel, bird or other small animal follows you around and doesn’t leave you alone. The animal causes trouble, described by the GM – it might make a noise at some inappropriate time, eat your food or steal something.

## HUNT
Another way to find food during a journey is to HUNT. You cannot HIKE at the same time as you HUNT. However, several people can HUNT at the same time. If you want to roll separately you cannot HUNT in the same location, which means that any mishaps will affect you individually. An option is that one of you HUNTS and the others help.
You need some form of gear to HUNT – either a ranged weapon or a hunting trap of some type (see the table on page 184). First, you must find your prey, which you can do by making a SURVIVAL roll (see the MASTER OF THE HUNT and HUNTING INSTINCTS talents in Chapter 4).
Success means that you find some kind of prey. Roll on the table above to see what type of animal it is. If you roll multiple x, you can reroll on the hunting table once per extra x. You cannot go back to a previous result. To kill your prey you must roll again, this time for MARKSMANSHIP (if using a weapon) or SURVIVAL again (if you are using a trap). Modify the roll with the difficulty of the animal, according to the table. You don’t need to fight the animal, rolling once is enough. Note that some animals cannot be caught with a trap. The table to the upper left indicates how many units of MEAT and PELTS your prey yields. The MEAT can be cooked by a CHEF (see page 74) or at an INN (see page 168), and is then turned into an equal amount of FOOD. You can eat MEAT raw – you then consume a unit of MEAT instead of rolling your Resource Die for FOOD. You need to do this within a day, or the MEAT will be spoiled. The PELTS can be turned into LEATHER by a TANNER (see page 82), preferably at a TANNERY (see page 172).
If your first SURVIVAL roll fails, you suffer a mishap. Roll on the table to the lower left. If your second roll fails to kill your prey, it only means you don’t get the FOOD – unless it is a boar, in which case it immediately attacks

#### HUNTING
| D6 | ANIMAL | DIFFICULTY | REQUIREMENT | MEAT | PELTS |
|----|--------|------------|-------------|------|-------|
| 1 | Mouse | +1 | Weapon or trap | 1 | –
| 2 | Crow | 0 | Weapon | 1 | –
| 3 | Rabbit | +1 | Weapon or trap | 2 | 1
| 4 | Fox | –1 | Weapon or trap | 3 | 1
| 5 | Boar | –1* | Weapon | 4 | 2 |
| 6 | Deer | 0 | Weapon | 5 | 3 |
* Boars attack you if you fail.

#### HUNTING MISHAPS
| D6 | MISHAP | EFFECT   |
|----|--------|---------|
| 1 | Sprained ankle | You fall or twist your ankle and suffer a critical injury, equivalent to result 25–26 in the table for blunt trauma on page 197.
| 2 | Lost gear/weapon | You lose some of your hunting gear or a weapon. The GM decides which.
| 3 | Torn Clothes | Your clothes are damaged. Your boots break or your robe rips on thorny plants or sharp rocks. You must roll for for the effects of cold. Your clothes can be mended by making a successful CRAFTING roll.
| 4 | Trap | You step into another hunter’s trap. It could be a snare, a net, or a covered pit. You suffer one point of damage to Strength and must make a MOVE roll to get out of the trap.
| 5 | Savage Animal | A wolf, bear or other wild animal feels threatened, and attacks you. The GM chooses an animal from the table on page 124 of the Gamemaster’s Guide.
| 6 | Sick Prey | You bring down a random animal, but is sick and whoever eats of its flesh is infected by a disease with a Virulence rating of 3. This is discovered during your next meal.

## FISH
If you are in a hexagon by a river or lake or by the ocean you can FISH. If you are on foot, you cannot HIKE while FISHING, but you can FISH from a moving boat. Several people can FISH at the same ## time. If you want to roll separately you cannot FISH in the same location, which means that any mishaps will affect you individually. Alternatively, one of you FISHES and the others help. To FISH, you need fishing gear (see the table on page 184). Make a SURVIVAL roll modified by the FISHER talent and any Gear Bonus from your fishing gear.
Success means you catch a number of units of FISH equal to the number of x you rolled. The FISH can be cooked by a CHEF (see page 74) or at an INN (see page 168), and is then turned into an equal amount of FOOD. You can eat FISH raw – you then consume a unit of FISH instead of rolling your Resource Die for FOOD. You need to do this within a day, or the FISH will be spoiled. If your roll fails, you don’t catch any FISH and you also suffer a mishap. Roll on the table on the previous page.

#### FISHING MISHAPS
| D6 | MISHAP | EFFECT |
|----|-----|-----|
| 1 | Snagged Hook/Net | Your hook or net snags on the bottom. You must make a MIGHT roll to be able to retrieve your fishing gear. If you fail, it is lost.
| 2 | Hook in Finger | You manage to pierce your own finger with the hook, instead of hooking a fish. You suffer one point of damage to Strength. Reroll if fishing with a net.
| 3 | Broken Fishing Gear | Your fishing gear breaks. You need to repair it (a CRAFTING roll) or get new gear.
| 4 | Mosquito Swarm | A large swarm of mosquitoes or gnats attacks you, driving you crazy with their bites and buzzing. They attack with four Base Dice, causing damage to Empathy.
| 5 | Splash! | You lose your balance and fall into the water. See rules for swimming and drowning on page 113.
| 6 | Attacked | A vicious fish or eel attacks you, causing a nasty bleeding wound. You suffer 1 point of damage to Strength.

## MAKE CAMP
When the journey of the day is over, it’s time to MAKE CAMP. Finding a good location for a camp, making a fire, and preparing where to SLEEP takes a whole Quarter Day – usually the Evening. Only one person rolls to MAKE CAMP, but others can help her (see page 48). Make a SURVIVAL roll, modified by the QUARTERMASTER talent. If your roll succeeds, you find a sheltered and comfortable place to spend the night, where you can all rest up before the next day’s journey. If your roll fails, your camp is less pleasant. You still set up a camp where you can REST and SLEEP, but the GM makes a hidden roll on the mishap table below. The GM can spring this mishap on you anytime she wants while you are in the camp.

**STANDING GUARD:** The wilderness is a dangerous place and even while you are in your camp, you need a sentry to stay awake to KEEP WATCH (see above). You need to choose who stands guard during the Night, and let this
person SLEEP during some other Quarter Day (usually the Evening).

#### MAKING CAMP MISHAPS
| D66 | MISHAP | EFFECT |
|----|-------|------|
| 11–13 | Spoiled Water |The water you are carrying has spoiled. Everyone in the group must reduce their Resource Die for water by one step.
| 14–16 | Rotten Food | Your food has rotted or been infected by insects. Everyone in the group must reduce their Resource Die for food by one step.
| 21–25 | Bad Campsite | Your campsite turns out to be very uncomfortable to sleep in. No one in the group gets any SLEEP at all until you have found a new campsite.
| 26–32 | Downpour | A massive rainfall starts in the middle of the night. The camp is flooded and everything gets soaking wet. All adventurers must roll for the effects of cold, and no one gets any SLEEP this night.
| 33–36 | Fire Dies | The firewood is wet, and your campfire goes out. Everyone in the group must roll for the effects of cold (see page 111).
| 41–42 | Fire! | Suddenly, the flames from your campfire spread out of control. Your tents, sleeping furs and other gear catch fire. Each adventurer suffers an attack with five Base Dice (Weapon Damage 1). Each adventurer must also make a MOVE roll to save her gear. Failure means that one piece of equipment (the GM decides which) is lost in the fire. 
| 43–45 | Ants | Your camp sits right in the middle of an ant road. You all suffer 1 point of damage to Agility and no one gets any SLEEP here.
| 46–51 | Lice | A randomly selected adventurer has caught lice. It itches horribly, and she gets a rash all over the body. The victim suffers 1 point of damage to Agility each day and cannot SLEEP. A successful HEALING roll stops the effect.
| 52–54 | Mosquito Swarm | A large swarm of mosquitoes or gnats attacks the camp, driving everyone crazy with their bites and buzzing. They attack all adventurers with four Base Dice, causing damage to Empathy.
| 55–56 | Savage Animal | A wolf, bear or other wild animal feels threatened, and attacks you. The GM chooses an animal from the table on page 124 of the Gamemaster’s Guide.
| 61–63 | Lost Gear | A randomly selected adventurer has lost a piece of gear. The GM decides what was lost, and if it can be found.
| 64–66 | Broken Gear | An item belonging to a randomly selected adventurer is broken. The GM decides what item it is. The item can be repaired with a CRAFTING roll.

#### REST
Resting by the campfire is a good opportunity to recover from damage. Read more about recovery on page 108. If your REST is interrupted by something dramatic, like combat or other similar activity, your activity during the Quarter Day no longer counts as REST.

#### SLEEP
You have to SLEEP at least one Quarter Day per day (usually during the Night) to avoid becoming SLEEPY (see page 111). If your SLEEP is interrupted by something dramatic, like combat or other similar activity, your activity during the Quarter Day no longer counts as SLEEP.

_BARE GROUND_
_It is possible to SLEEP in the wilderness without MAKING CAMP – you simply find a suitable tree to SLEEP under. You save the time it takes to MAKE CAMP, but everyone in the group must make a SURVIVAL roll to find a good spot to SLEEP. Failure means the individual doesn’t SLEEP at all, and thus becomes SLEEPY (see page 111). Since you don’t have a fire to keep the cold away, you all also suffer the effects of cold (see page 111)._

## EXPLORE
When you stop at an adventure site to EXPLORE it, your journey is interrupted. EXPLORING an adventure site can take anything from a Quarter Day up to several days or even weeks. Sometimes, you might have to take abreak to REST or SLEEP while EXPLORING. You cannot REST or SLEEP during the same Quarter as you EXPLORE.

## SEA TRAVEL
If you have access to a boat or raft (see the table on page 190), you can cross a river without using a bridge or a ford. You can also travel along a river, across a lake or on an ocean. Travel by sea works like journeys on land, but with some differences. Instead of a pathfinder, a boat has a skipper, who LEADS THE WAY (roll for SURVIVAL modified by the SAILOR talent) in each new hexagon. Failure takes you into the new hexagon anyway, but you must make a roll on the mishap table.

#### SEA TRAVEL MISHAPS
| D6 | MISHAP | EFFECT |
|----|--------|--------|
| 1 | Navigational Error | You sail off course and make no progress on the map during this Quarter Day.
| 2 | Sudden Squall | A sudden squall makes your boat tilt suddenly. One important item falls into the water. The GM decides what it is.
| 3 | Whirlpool | Your boat is caught in a whirlpool. The skipper must make a SURVIVAL roll (modified by the SAILOR talent). Failure means the boat runs aground and has to be repaired (a CRAFTING roll) before your journey can continue.
| 4 | Leak | Your boat springs a leak and takes on water. The leak must be repaired (a CRAFTING roll), which takes one turn (15 minutes), but your journey can continue while you do so. If the leak is not repaired, the boat sinks after D6 hours.
| 5 | Overboard | Someone in the group (GM’s choice) falls overboard after a large wave hits the boat. See rules for swimming and drowning on page 113.
| 6 | Grounding | Your boat runs aground and must be abandoned or repaired witha CRAFTING roll. The boat must be on the shore to be repaired.
