### Things be Splintered

* Shields shall be splintered (add attribution) - can only be used by player characters and henchmen (specifically retainers with character levels) and foes with levels (or equivalent).
* "Weapons be shattered!" - weapons can be sacrifieced to do maximum damage.  Arrows, quarrels, sling stones/bullets, and similarly single-use items, as well as darts and javelins can not be shattered to this effect.  
* Hirelings be splinitered
* Sanity by splinitered

### Sacrifice Oneself
* Character can move to take a blow for another character or retainer, provided they are in the same or logically adjacent zone.

### War Cry
* Improves morale of your side or reduces morale of opponents

### Death
* 0 hp: bleeding and helpless, lose 1hp a round
* -1 hp: save vs death or die. Success = stable, but unconscious
* -2 hp: save vs death or die. Success = stable, but scared and unconsious
* -3 hp: save vs death or die. That's the end of your mortal form
* Maybe roll on Mordheim/BB table at 0 hp instead

### Roll Defense
Players roll to avoid attacks instead of monsters and other does rolling to attack.  In basic Guisarmes, the process is:
* Roll 1d20 and add your defense bonus (typically armor class + dexterity modifiers).  
* The referee compares to the foe's attack value and will inform you successful defense.  Alternately they may tell you the number your need to roll against.  
* Failure indicates the character taking damage or other effect of a successful attack from that foe.

### Crushing Blow 
_(Needs a better name)_ The attacker strike in despration, sacrificing their weapon in a brutal attack.  The weapon does maximum damage (6 points if the normal damage is d6, 8 points if the normal damage is 2d4, etc), but the weapon is destroyed in the process.  All normal modifiers to damage (strength bonus, etc) apply.  This attack is not effective with improvised, expendable, or missile (arrows, bolts, sling stones/bullets, etc) weapons.
