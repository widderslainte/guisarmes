## Health and Healing

### Death
Upon reaching zero hit points, the character collapses and is unstable and barely conscious. The character must immediately make a save versus death, or perish immediately.  A successful save indicates that the character is losing consciousness and bleeding. The character will still dye in 3 rounds or upon taking further damage (such a coup de gras), unless basic medicine treatment (bind of wounds, etc) is applied. 

Nonmagical treatments will bring the character to 1 hit point, but they will remain unconsious until a full day's rest or magical healing occurs.  Spells or other magic capable of immediately restoring hit points will bring the character to 1 hp and consciousness (regardless of the standard effect, such as d8 points from potion).  

### Healing
Natural healing occurs any character who rests one period and has had food and water within the past daily cycle.  The period that rest occurs does not matter, as long it constitutes sleep, medition, or non-strenous activities, but healing rest cannot be achieved more than once a daily cycle.

Full rest restores 1 HP per character hit die.  Example: a 4th level fighter would be healed 4 hp from a full rest.
