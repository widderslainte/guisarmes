In melee range is a simple equation. If you are being attacked by someone with a greater range than your own, when you attack you roll 2d20 and pick the worse result. This means a spearman can get swarmed, and a pikeman backing up a group of "Sword and Buckler" men is much more effective at taking down a lone ogre.


Initiative uses the "roll then interrupt" method. Lowest initiative does something, someone with a higher initiative can interupt. An example was the last pirate combat. The enemy boarders had the lowest initiave so they declare they were swinging over, the mage had a higher initiative so he interrupted with casting a wall of thorns (now the boarders will swing into a wall of thorns), the enemy captain has a higher initiative and interrupts by firing at the mage (hoping to screw up the spell), while the PC sharpshooter has the highest initiative and interrupted the captain with a shot, killing him. Then the captain would go (except he's dead) then the mage casts the wall of thorns, then the boarders swing into the wall of thorns. Then it continues."
