# Attributes in D&D Variants
_https://nilisnotnull.blogspot.com/2013/07/attributes-in-d.html_

The only system I can recall that tries to group attributes orthogonal to mental/physical is Star Frontiers, it actually even affects (advanced) character creation there. But for what it's worth, I think this breakdown of the D&D attributes is actually nicer.

Mayfair Games' DC Heroes did something like this. Had nine stats in a 3x3 grid:

Dexterity...Strength...Body
Intellect...Will.......Mind
Influence...Aura.......Spirit

Rows were Physical, Mental and Social/Mystical attributes.

Columns were the Action (how well you attack), Effect (how hard you hit) and Resistance (how well you resist getting hit) attributes.

Additionally, the Action column attributes were added up to come up with an Initiative score.

I liked the codification of the "mind, body and spirit" triad.

As a counter point, I no longer view the ability scores as either mental or physical, but all as a combination of both.

* Strength is not only muscle mass but the willingness to really hurt that guy or the gumption to *try* to lift that gate.
* Sense is how sharp your eyes and ears are AND how well you focus on details
* Dexterity is hand-eye coordination and the strength of character to try to pick that lock.
* Charisma is a combination of looks, charm and personability.
* Constitution combines physical hardiness and the sheer will to endure.

Not sure the distinction is that important, but it frees you up to associate a skills or powers to more than just one ability score, grants justification to adjust Saving Throw, etc.

* Fudge - maybe no attributes - no strength, just skills
