## Attributes
The basic attributes are nothing unique to Guisarmes & Golems.  Unlike other sections of the rules, I haven’t even bothered to confusingly rename them.  Outside of the direct mechanical effects describe, use whatever interpretation you prefer from your favourite edition or retroclone.

### Generation of Attribute Scores
Roll 3d6 in order.  This order:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma.  Record these and come back to this section once you’ve selected your character’s ancestry.

* **Strength:** modifies attack and damage rolls in non-missile combat and open doors
* **Intelligence:** modifies known languages, saves against Magician's spells, and Magician research rolls
* **Wisdom:** modifies saves againt Prophet's spells and Propher research rolls.
* **Dexterity:** modifiers attack rolls in missile combat, armor class (in normal situations)
* **Constitution:** modifiers hit points rolled, other tests and measures of endurance
* **Charisma:** modifiers reaction and loyalty for potential and current hirelings and henchmen

**Vat Creations (See Appendix):**  can swap any score with Strength. Charisma can not be their highest attribute - in that event swap Strength and Charisma attributes.

**Humans:** can swap any two scores.

Any swapping of scores must result in the attribute listed become higher than initially (i.e, a Vat Creation could not swap an Intelligence of 10 with a Strength of 12).
