**Talisman, Mindat**: Creation of Talismans is an essential element of Mindat magical traditions, crafted from clay and copper.  Talismans are message in quality (likelihood of effect) and efficacy (power of effect). Talismans protect a single specific spell or effect, determined at creation time. After a successful use, the talisman crumbles.
