### Spellbooks

#### From UA
There are two kinds of spell books:
1. Standard books, each of which contains up to 36 cantrips, up to 24 spells of 1st-3rd level, up to 16 spells of 4th-6th level, or up to 8 spells of 7th-9th level.
2. Travelling books, each of which contains at most one-fourth of the number of spells possible to be contained in a standard spell book — either nine cantrips; six spells of 1st, 2nd, and/or 3rd level; four spells of 4th, 5th, and/or 6th level; or two spells of 7th, 8th, and/or 9th level. 

##### Cost of spell books
A standard spell book costs 1,000 gp for materials, plus an additional 100 gp per spell level for each spell contained therein. (For this determination and all other similar ones, consider cantrips as 1st-level spells.) The cost of a new magic-user’s or illusionist’s initial book or books is assumed to be borne by the new spell caster’s former master, so the fledgling spell caster will have one or two spell books at no cost to him or her. Books which are prepared later in a magic-user’s career (having higher spell-level capacity than “beginning” books) are not supplied by the character’s master, but must be composed by the character in question as part of his or her training when the spell caster is trying to rise to a higher experience level. This composition will take from 4-7 weeks for each new standard book;  the book is composed during and after the time when other training exercises are
taking place.

These same costs/prices apply when such a book is being manufactured and composed: Any standard spell book requires a 1,000 gp investment for materials, plus 100 gp per level for each spell entered within the book, payable when a magic-user adds a new spell to his or her repertoire. (Entering a 1st-level spell costs 100 gp, a 2nd-level spell
costs 200 gp, etc.)

A travelling spell book costs 500 gold pieces for materials. The cost of each spell contained within such a book is the same as the cost for entering a spell in a standard book. All travelling spell books must be fabricated by the magic-user, or otherwise discovered as treasure by the magic-user or his or her associates. A player character cannot automatically possess a travelling spell book at the beginning of his or her career.

##### Physical aspects of standard books
A standard spell book is approximately 16 inches in height, 12 inches wide, and 6 inches thick. (The DM has leeway to reduce or enlarge this general size, although nothing smaller than 12×12×6 inches or larger than 18×12×9 inches is recommended.) The weight of a standard book of median size is 150 gold pieces (adjusted upward or downward for
varying sizes). The encumbrance value of such a book is equal to three times its weight (450 gp or thereabouts), although it is correct to assume that a volume will fit within an otherwise empty backpack or large sack.

The cover of a standard book is typically heavy leather — dragon hide or something similar — inlaid with metal so as to provide both extra durability and a means to close and secure the book. Vellum pages are sewn together and secured to a fine, supple leather spine backing. Pages are secured additionally by fine leather front and back pieces. It is also usual for such a tome to have vellum stubs at intervals for insertion of additional pages, although this by no means allows for any increase or change in the number and types of spells the book can contain. Notwithstanding any special protections placed thereon, a standard spell book has a saving throw equal to that of “leather or book,” and with +2 to dice rolls made to save against acid, fireball, disintegration, and lightning attacks.

##### Physical aspects of travelling books
A travelling spell book is approximately 12 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 1 inch thick; 9×9×1 is likewise a good working size. The weight of such a book is approximately 30 gold pieces, and encumbrance roughly 60 gp. Five such books will fit within a backpack, twice that number in a large sack.

The cover of a travelling spell book is strong, supple leather, such as that from a giant cobra. The hand-sewn leaves of parchment are carefully secured to a fine leather backing and glued to the spine. The whole is further secured by front and back pieces of vellum. A small lock or leather ties are typically used to secure the whole. Pages are very thin and fragile, so great care must be taken to protect the book when it is in use.

Notwithstanding any special protections placed thereon, a travelling spell book has a saving throw equal to that of “leather or book,” with no bonuses (as a standard book has) against certain forms of attack.
