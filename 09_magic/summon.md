# Summon
| Magic-User | Level 1 |
|---|---|
| Duration:| See Below
| Range:| 10'

Magic fundamentally works by ripping a hole in the fabric of space and time and pulling out energy that interacts with and warps our reality. Various mages have managed to consistently capture specific energy in exact amounts to produce replicable results: Spells.

The Summon spell opens the rift between the worlds a little bit more and forces an inhabitant From Beyond into our world to do the Magic-User's bidding. What exactly comes through the tear, and whether or not it will do what the summoner wishes, is wholly unpredictable. 

Summon spells to call specific beings can be researched (or discovered). They will be first level spells but must be researched as if they were a level equal to the summoned creature’s Hit Dice + Number of Powers

Once the Summon spell is cast, there are a number of steps to resolve:

## Summary
¶ The caster chooses the intended Power of the Summoned Entity
¶ The caster makes a saving throw versus Magic
¶ Determine the Entity’s Form
¶ Determine the Entity’s Powers
¶ Resolve the Domination Roll

* **Determine HD** (equals power of creature- more than 2x of MU will not appear) 
* **Save VS magic:** Fail = more powerful creature may appear. Powers and form determined randomly.
* Domination roll - Opposed roll: The Magic-User- d20 + caster's level + Thaumaturgic Circle Modifiers + Sacrifice Modifiers. Creature rolls d20 + Hit Dice + Number of Powers.
    * **Magic User Wins** - Margin of Victory = #d10’s rolled for creature duration. Caster must concentrate on controlling creature entire time. Not concentrating or interruption = another Domination roll. Will not extend duration, just place creature back under control. Creature winning is just base victory.
    * If the Magic-User wins by 5 + creature’s Hit Dice + the number of its powers, MU doesn’t need to concentrate. Can ask for longer service of creature. The details of this service must be communicated in a clear and succinct manner.
    * Wins by a margin of 19 or more (or double a Great Margin), the creature is bound permanently in our world, and under the complete control of the caster, with no direct concentration requires to maintain this control.
    * **Creature wins** - it will lash out, attempt to fuck up all living creatures for duration (rounds = to d10 x the margin it won, min rounds = to its HD). If the creature wins by 5 + Magic-User's Hit Dice + Sacrifice + thaumaturgic Circle modifiers, the caster is the creatures bitch. Roll d6 and consult the Dominating Creature table to determine what happens (pg 144)
    * Wins the roll by 19 or more (or double a Great Margin), it must make a d20 roll. 1 – 19- empowered by energy from its own dimension and multiplies its Hit Dice by d4+1. Goes on a killing rampage. Extra roll = 20, the barrier between realities is sundered, and the monstrosities begin dropping through. Hundreds of them will come through in the first hour, then about a hundred a day for the next week, then just a few a day. All will be hostile, as their passage to this world is accidental and our reality unfamiliar and unpleasant to their sensibilities.
* **Thaumaturgic Circles** - Each 500sp worth of materials = +1 to Domination Roll.
* **Sacrifices** - Each 2 full HD of sacrifices gives +1 to Domination Roll. Each 1HD of sacrifice of same race as MU gives +1. Sacrifice must be helpless at time of killing.
* **Default Stats** - AC 12, 1 attack for d6 damage, Move 120’ (ground), ML 10. Changes to these stats will be noted with the appropriate entries.
* **Appendages** - Bold # is Hit Dice consult number next to for die type to equal appendages number. Roll for base number of appendages. Roll again. If number is less than original roll keep rolling till equal or greater
than. Generate that number of appendages by following instructions below: 0- d2; 1- d4; 2-4- d6; 5-7- d8; 8-10- d10; 11-14+- 1d12


### Step One
**The caster must decide how powerful a creature** — expressed in terms of Hit Dice — he will attempt to summon. This cannot be more than two times the caster's level, but this effective level for this purpose can be modified by Thaumaturgic Circles and Sacrifices — see below.

### Step Two
**The caster must make a saving throw versus Magic.** Failing this saving throw means a more powerful creature than anticipated might come through the tear in the fabric of reality, which can have dire consequences for all present.

### Step Three
The creature's form and powers will be randomly determined on the following tables, with different results altering the creature's basic stats. Those default stats are: 

* AC: 12, 1 attack for 1d6 damage, Move 120' (ground), ML10.
* To determine the creature’s basic form, roll 1d12 if the original casting save was made, 1d20 if it was not.

#### Form 
Each basic form that is not from the Abstract Forms category will have a number of additional features. The base Hit Dice of the creature that the caster wished to summon determines the die type used to determine additional features as follows:

| Hit Dice | Die Type     |
|----------|--------------|
|  0       | (1d6 hp) 1d2 |
|  1       | 1d4          |
|  2 - 4   | 1d6   |
|  5 - 7   | 1d8   |
|  8 - 10  | 1d10  |
| 11 - 13  | 1d12  |
| 14 +     | 1d20  |

Roll the indicated die type… This is the Base Number. Roll that die again. If the new roll is less than the Base Number, then roll an appendage on the following table. Roll again and keep adding appendages until a new roll greater than, or equal to, the previous roll is made.

#### Appendages
... to be addded

### Step Four
To determine the number of powers that a creature has, use the base Hit Dice of the creature that the caster wished to summon to determine which die type to use according to the following table:

| HD   | Die Type |
|------|--------|
|  0   | (1d6 hp) 1d2
|  1   | 1d4
| 2–4  | 1d6
| 5–7  | 1d8
| 8–10 | 1d10
| 11–13| 1d12
| 14+  | 1d20

Roll the indicated die type… This is the Base Number. Roll that die again. If the initial saving throw in Step Two was successful, the entity has a special power if the second roll is less than the Base Number. Roll again and keep adding special powers until a new roll greater than, or equal to, the previous roll is made. However, if the initial saving throw was failed, a new power is gained on a roll less than, or equal to, the Base Number, so the creature will have a greater chance to have more powers than if the casting was more controlled. If a 1 is rolled, however, no further rolls can be made.

The possible powers of a summoned entity can be randomly determined on the following table. Reroll any duplicate results.

**Added Powers Table**

### Step Five
The Domination roll requires two 1d20 rolls, one on behalf of the caster, the other on behalf of the summoned entity. The caster's level, Thaumaturgic Circle Modifiers, and Sacrifice modifiers are added to his roll.

The creature's Hit Dice is added to its roll, and it also receives +1 to the roll for every Power it has.

#### Domination Roll Results
**If the Magic-User wins, the margin of victory determines how many d10s to roll to determine how many Rounds the creature will be under the caster's control.** The caster must concentrate on controlling the creature for this period of time, and if the caster's concentration is broken (by being damaged, or casting another spell, for instance), there must be another Domination roll to determine if the creature will remain under control (this second roll can only confirm the original term of control, not extend it, and at most the creature can only win a basic victory in this second contest). The creature returns to its dimension when this time ends.

If the Magic-User wins by a Great Margin (equal to, or greater than, 5 + creature’s Hit Dice + the number of its Powers), the caster can demand a longer service from the creature without needing to consciously direct it. The details of this service must be communicated in a clear and succinct manner.

If the caster wins by a margin of 19 or more (or double a Great Margin), the creature is bound permanently in our world, and under the complete control of the caster, with no direct concentration required to maintain this control.

**If the creature wins the Domination roll, it will simply lash out, attempting to kill and maim all living creatures while it is stable in this reality (a number of Rounds equal to d10× the margin it won the Domination contest, minimum number of Rounds equal to its Hit Dice).**

If the creature wins by a Great Margin (greater or equal to: 5 + Magic-User's Hit Dice+Sacrifice + Thaumaturgic Circle modifiers), the caster is completely at the mercy of the creature, mind, body, and soul. Roll 1d6 and consult the Dominating Creature table below to determine what happens.

If the creature wins the roll by 19 or more (or double a Great Margin), it must make a 1d20 roll. On a 1–19 it is empowered by energy from its own dimension and multiplies its Hit Dice by 1d4+1. Re-roll its powers using its new Hit Dice as a base. It will then go on a killing rampage. If this extra roll is a 20, the barrier between realities is sundered, and innumerable monstrosities begin dropping through. Hundreds of them will come through in the first hour, then about a hundred a day for the next week, then just a few each day. All will be hostile, as their passage to this world is accidental and our reality will be unfamiliar and unpleasant to their sensibilities.

If the domination roll is a tie, then roll again, but this time, the caster uses a d12 instead of a d20, and Thaumaturgic and Sacrifice modifiers do not apply.

**Dominating Creature**
1. The creature retreats to its own reality, bringing the caster back with it. The caster's physical body is destroyed, but his mental essence exists forever in misery.
2. The creature's presence in this universe is stable and it will not be drawn back to its world. The caster's will is replaced with that of the creature, and the character becomes an NPC. If the creature and the Magic-User together have the strength to destroy everyone and everything in their immediate surroundings, they will do so. If there is doubt about their ability to accomplish this, the creature and caster will retreat and begin their long-range campaign to bring about Hell on Earth.
3. The creature holds the rift open longer than it was supposed to be; 1d10 more creatures with Hit Dice ranging from 1 to the summoned creature's Hit Dice, flood into the physical world. They will attempt to slay and consume every living thing.
4. The creature and the Magic-User merge to form one being. It can switch between the two physical forms at will, and in either form possesses all the powers of both beings. The creature is in control.
5. The creature explodes on contact with our universe, disrupting all sense of self and identity. All human or human-like characters within 120' are randomly switched into new bodies, with the levels and class abilities of the new body (all bodies must change, even if a random roll puts a character back in their original body). Characters retain their previous Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom, and take on the Constitution, Dexterity, Strength, Class, Level, and Hit Points of the new body. All present are now Chaotic in alignment, and any Clerics lose their Cleric spells.
6. The creature is not at all interested in being in “reality,” nor does it care about anyone present. It is however supremely vexed at being called through the veil by a piece of meat. It will take one of the caster's comrades as compensation.
The caster must choose one of his fellow player characters, and then that character will simply cease to be. If the caster delays, or chooses anyone else than a player character, then all the player characters in the area will be winked out of existence… and the caster will be left alone.

#### Thaumaturgic Circles and Sacrifices
Using Thaumaturgic Circles and offering Sacrifice while casting the spell makes the portal between worlds more interesting, attracting greater creatures to the summoning point and so allowing them to be summoned. It also numbs the consciousness of these creatures, such as it is, allowing a Magic-User to more easily control greater creatures.

Each full 2 Hit Dice of sacrifices gives the caster a +1 bonus to the Domination roll, or 1 Hit Die for a +1 bonus if the sacrifice is the same race as the caster. To count as a sacrifice, the victim must be helpless at the time of the slaying and purposefully slain for just this purpose. Combat deaths do not count.

Thaumaturgic Circles are magical diagrams (or mathematical equations which are nonsense in our world, but important in some other) used to focus magical energy and give the caster greater control over his summoning. The diagrams are not enough, though. The materials used to draw and decorate the circles are crucial to communicating their information to the summoned creatures. 500 sp worth of materials is required to invest in a circle for every +1 bonus to the caster's Domination roll, and this is consumed with every casting.
