## Spell Types
* Tutelary - can be cast in place of prepared spell of same or greater effective level.  Known to all characters of the class or specialization.
* Cantrap - aside from successive turns, can be cast at any time with a successful roll (save versus corruption, mutation or other standard of the rules system)
* Ritual - can not be prepared, requires a one hour per effective spell level and relative quiet (in camp, but not in a tavern)
* Malleable - can be prepared and cast as normal or performed as a ritual (with standard casting time)
