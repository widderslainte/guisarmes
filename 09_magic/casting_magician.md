## General and Preparation

* Can only prepare a given spell once (can't prepare 3x sleep spells) - can be done via risky casting
* Spells can be cast as lower (caster) level
* Start with three random spells, no read magic
* Comprehend Languages will allow reading and transcription of spellbooks and scrolls

## Normal Casting


## Risky Casting
Save or roll on miscast table for the following conditions - penalty to save for multiple conditions:

Casting after per day spell limits reaching (all spells expended)
Casting spell that has not been prepared
Casting from anotherâ€™s spellbook
Casting while encumbered
Casting while taking damage


* Spellbooks and Scrolls may be encoded, but otherwise written in an ancient, dead, or obscure languages.  Magicians are considered to have knowledge of one such language for their use and may roll upon that skill when encountered others' scrolls and spellbooks.
