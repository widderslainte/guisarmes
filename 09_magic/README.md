## Magic

_"In this games it is spoken of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; magicians are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.‚Äù_
