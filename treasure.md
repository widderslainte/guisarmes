## Treasure Detection, Evaluation and Experience

Normally (and this where I meant some merged remembering of conventions from other rules versions or campaigns)  I break treasure into "known values" (typically coins), magic, and "assessed values".  

Magic items may be identified by use (a warrior using a magic sword after a battle or an afternoon of practice, for example), experimentation, or use of the Identify spell (differences between LotfP and AD&D 1st edition versions to be discussed, but I think either version is valid).  Scrolls can be identified by Read Magic, and are presumed to do so if a relevant party member spends more than a day of free time in town. A sip of potion will provide a vague hint and frequently identified outright if a similar type has been ingested before.  Exceptions may occur.  As an exception to the above, unused magic items can be "stowed" in bags or sacks as later identified and/or sold, with XP provided from the sale value.

"Assessed values" like gems, jewelry, furs, etc should have some sort of merchant/expert review and either sold or given to a character for ownership/share of treasure.  If we're back in town and I know you have a 500gp gem and only need 100xp to level, we'd "front" you enough to keep everything going.
