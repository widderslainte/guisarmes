## Treasure Detection, Evaluation and Experience

Normally (and this where I meant some merged remembering of conventions from other rules versions or campaigns)  I break treasure into "known values" (typically coins), magic, and "assessed values".  

Magic should be used, detected (per the spell or observation), or identified (in the AD&D sense).  A warrior would know there's something special about a +1 sword after a battle or an hour/afternoon of practice.  

"Assessed values" like gems, jewelry, furs, etc should have some sort of merchant/expert review and either sold or given to a character for ownership/share of treasure.  If we're back in town and I know you have a 500gp gem and only need 100xp to level, we'd "front" you enough to keep everything going.
